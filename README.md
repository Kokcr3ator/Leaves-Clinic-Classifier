# Pandas4x4-ANN
1st place 99.9% accuracy test set.  
Ciao belli, l'obiettivo è quello scritto nella riga sopra. 

## Warning!
1. Create your own branch and work on it, rather than on the main one. Use the command from terminal: git checkout -b <branch_name>
2. Every time you start to work, make sure that your branch is up to date performing git pull origin main. Only then work on it, otherwise you will have merge conflicts (and you don't want to have merge conflicts)

## Folder and files description
challenge1.ipynb    ->    main script, with models, training...

public_data.npz    ->    dataset 

models_submissions_files    ->    a folder for each saved model, model.py and metadata

## Submission
Put in a folder:
- the folder corresponding to the model you want to submit (this folder has to be renamed to 'SubmissionModel' for the submission to work)
- model.py
- metadata

 (You should find everything in the models_submissions_files folder).
 
Compress this folder into a zip.

Go to https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/16245#participate-submit_results and upload your .zip folder clicking on the 'Submit' button.

## Logs
It will be really useful and timesaving if everytime we do some work for the challenge, we write down all the interesting things we have done (successes, errors, your thoughts, the ideas you are exploring, problems encountered, questions): in this way writing the report will be way more simple and will result in the most complete version of it.

To do this use the Slack workspace at link https://join.slack.com/t/pandas4x4anndl/shared_invite/zt-26417lthx-QdMfAAzTZwwTtWkpKLSNng and go to channel #challenge1-log

## Primissime cose da fare:  
### - Guardare il dataset e capire quali potrebbero essere le potenziali problematicità
### - Creare una baseline
