# Leaves Classfication Challenge
2023 Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning's course at Politecnico di Milano hosted a binary image classification challenge.
The implemented model achieved 0.9270 accuracy on the hidden test set and placed 1st in the leaderboard of the competition. \
The challenge involved designing and implementing a binary classifier using a deep learning architecture to distinguish between images of healthy and unhealthy leaves. \
The initial dataset (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1llWCmIbaW-uHvZcD-soT8DJQJYmm8zAA/view?usp=drive_link) comprised 5200 96x96 RGB images. \
